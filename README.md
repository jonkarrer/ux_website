# UX : User Experience

## Summary

This material comes from HECMontrealX's [Ed Ex](https://www.edx.org/) courses. These are my personal notes after taking the classes and may not be suffecient for deep understanding of UX.

## How to use

Each branch is a seperate module starting from week one to the end. Each represent how the courses were broken up, roughly. Select the Module you want and simply analyze the read me. Enjoy!
