# Module Three

## UX Design

> "UI is the saddle, the stirrups and the reins. UX is the feeling you get when riding the horse."

1. UX Life Cycle.

   - We use a four phase model to describe the design process:
     Analyze, design, prototype, evaluate. these are simply the steps
     anyone goes through when solving a problem.

   - Analyse is about researching the user experience
     and checking on other parameters of the project
     before looking for solutions.

   - Design is about conceiving new or renewed user experiences.

   - Prototype is to develop the first drafts
     of the upcoming interface, and thus prototyping the experience.

   - Evaluate tests every step of the process
     keeping the team's eye on the user's experience,
     not just on the interface.

2. The UX Project

   - The tools and techniques that are used throughout the project.

   - The four phase design process is often confused with another four-part process:
     the IT project. Discover, Define, Develop, Deploy.

   - Going back to the user-centered design process, there are a number
     of techniques used for each phase.

   - There are two types of activities in the analyze phase: one that gathers information, the other that collects user data informing the upcoming design phase.

   - With these, we will generate personas and a variety of experience map:
     empathy map, experience map, journey map, service design blueprint

   - The design phase includes: the vision workshop, Design Thinking, multiple
     brainstorming techniques, co-design and participatory design and even storytelling
     and storyboarding techniques.

   - The prototyping phase covers UI design, which is actually not a technique
     but a practice domain onto itself, persuasive design, gamification
     and once the actual prototyping starts, card sorting, paper prototyping,
     wire framing and high fidelity prototyping as well.

## How Do You Do UX

> UX is a practice that can count on a rich toolbox of methods and techniques. From a laymanâ€™s perspective, these methods are just a way to get the results we want. But the fact is that each of these techniques is rooted in a proper scientific approach.

1. The scientific approach.

   - Theories are tentative explanations and to arrive at a good theory,
     scientists need to observe and test. Thus, they conduct scientific research.

   - We may want to perform a scientific research to test
     what is the minimal distance on an interface between two different
     functionalities for them to be perceived as different.

   - One of the characteristics of the scientific approach
     is that the test process used needs to be reproducible.

   - In conclusion, the literature suggests that they are four methods of knowing: tenacity, authority, intuition,science.

   - Science is the only method that corrects itself.

   - Qualitative and Quantitative methods are the industry standard approach. Feelings and numbers.
