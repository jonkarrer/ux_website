# Module One

## Introduction to UX

> You can't design an experience.
> An experience is what a person lives, experiences while doing something. The other side of the mirror. What is behind the eyes.

1. The object and the stakeholder.

   - Experiences always involve an object and a stakeholder.

   - First, an experience is always in relationship with an object of some sort.

   - Experiences also involve human stakeholders or any form of being

   - UX stakeholders belong to two categories: the people who use UX expertise and results to direct the project and those who rely on our work
     to produce their share of the project.

2. Kickoff Meeting

   - A formal stakeholder meeting, the kickoff will have the various points of view
     around the project surface in order to resolve them.

   - The purpose of this meeting is to define the project, its goals, its boundaries,
     what it wants to achieve and what is off limits, as well as to establish the success metrics

   - The real challenge lies in what to do with everyone's perspectives, needs and wants. The short answer is trade-offs. [Relavant Link](https://uxplanet.org/making-tradeoffs-as-a-ux-designer-d867fdf2cf8e)

3. Trade Offs

   - Product tradeoffs are making decisions based on what is needed, what can be done now, and where to make the most impact in order to meet present and future goals.

   - Design decisions are based on how visuals/flow will effectively lead to the user goal, and designing for now as well as the future in relation to the overarching problem and user.

4. 3 Design Assertions [Article Link](https://alistapart.com/article/practical-design-discovery/)

   1. <b>Principles</b> define what the design should or shouldnâ€™t do. These statements are grounded in research, and may be referred to as implications when you can tie them to research.

   2. <b>Concepts</b> establish an overall approach for the product, expressed as a central theme or idea.

   3. <b>Models</b> describe the product in an abstract way, showing the underlying architecture, structure, flow, or approach. They offer a sense of how the product will work (without actual functionality).
