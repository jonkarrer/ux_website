# Module Two

## When to use UX

1. UX Life Cycle.

   - We use a four phase model to describe the design process:
     Analyze, design, prototype, evaluate. these are simply the steps
     anyone goes through when solving a problem.

   - Analyse is about researching the user experience
     and checking on other parameters of the project
     before looking for solutions.

   - Design is about conceiving new or renewed user experiences.

   - Prototype is to develop the first drafts
     of the upcoming interface, and thus prototyping the experience.

   - Evaluate tests every step of the process
     keeping the team's eye on the user's experience,
     not just on the interface.

2. The UX Project

   - The tools and techniques that are used throughout the project.

   - The four phase design process is often confused with another four-part process:
     the IT project. Discover, Define, Develop, Deploy.

   - Going back to the user-centered design process, there are a number
     of techniques used for each phase.

   - There are two types of activities in the analyze phase: one that gathers information, the other that collects user data informing the upcoming design phase.

   - With these, we will generate personas and a variety of experience map:
     empathy map, experience map, journey map, service design blueprint.

   - The design phase includes: the vision workshop, Design Thinking, multiple
     brainstorming techniques, co-design and participatory design and even storytelling
     and storyboarding techniques.

   - The prototyping phase covers UI design, which is actually not a technique
     but a practice domain onto itself, persuasive design, gamification
     and once the actual prototyping starts, card sorting, paper prototyping,
     wire framing and high fidelity prototyping as well.

## How Do You Do UX

> UX is a practice that can count on a rich toolbox of methods and techniques. From a layman’s perspective, these methods are just a way to get the results we want. But the fact is that each of these techniques is rooted in a proper scientific approach.

1. The scientific approach.

   - Theories are tentative explanations and to arrive at a good theory,
     scientists need to observe and test. Thus, they conduct scientific research.

   - We may want to perform a scientific research to test
     what is the minimal distance on an interface between two different
     functionalities for them to be perceived as different.

   - One of the characteristics of the scientific approach
     is that the test process used needs to be reproducible.

   - In conclusion, the literature suggests that they are four methods of knowing: tenacity, authority, intuition,science.

   - Science is the only method that corrects itself.

   - Qualitative and Quantitative methods are the industry standard approach. Feelings and numbers.

2. Guerrilla Research Protocol

> Smart interviewers create space for stories to emerge.
> The moment the participant shifts from short answers
> to stories is THE TIPPING POINT IN AN INTERVIEW

1.  Prepare interview protocol;
    - Ux design brief
    - the type of experience & potential scenarios, and the typical user profile
2.  Prepare interview guide using an Empathy Map;
    - Using the six focus areas of the empathy map, you will be
      covering almost all the informa+on you need to construct
      personas and experience maps.
    - The purpose of the interview: understand par+cipants
      Mental Model regarding a given experience.
3.  Recruit participants;
    - The most significant difference between standard research and
      guerrilla research is the speed of recruiting.
4.  Conduct guerrilla interview;
5.  Debrief each interview immediately returning to the Empathy Map;
6.  Once all interviews are done, start the analysis process.
    - End goal: Iden-fy personas and their respec-ve experience.
      Subgoal: Iden-fy fresh insights that can lead to innova-ve design
      solu-ons for these personas.
7.  Finish the analysis process with a teammate or a friendly colleague.
    - What’s their core approach to this experience?
    - What’s unique in their point of view? in their mental model?
    - What’s leZ unsaid here? What’s missing to properly reflect the people you interviewed who gave rise to this persona?
